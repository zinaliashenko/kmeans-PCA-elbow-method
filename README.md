**data_2d_kmeans: Clustering mnist.csv using the KMeans method.**

***Description:***
The script uses the data from the mnist.csv file to determine the optimal number of clusters using the "Elbow" method. After determining the number of clusters, the KMeans method is used to create and visualize them.

***Using:***
1. Load the data from the mnist.csv file.
2. Run the script and view the "Elbow" graph to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. Run KMeans with the selected number of clusters and view the visualization.


**mnist_kmeans_PCA: Clustering data_2d.csv using the KMeans and PCA methods**

***Description:***
The script uses the data from the data_2d.csv file to determine the optimal number of clusters using the "Elbow" method. After determining the number of clusters, the KMeans method is used to create and visualize them.

***Using:***
1. Load the data from the data_2d.csv file.
2. Run the PCA method to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
3. Run the script and view the "Elbow" graph to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Run KMeans with the selected number of clusters and view the visualization.
